# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was mostly a learning experience on figuring out how to read javascript. I learned a lot about local vs global scopes while working on this, and a lot more on how things flow in JS. I also learned how to ask for help when I'm stuck, or else I won't be able to move forward and will remain stubborn. 

Alongside this, it's also good reference on how to connect a table to JS and plenty of other things. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
