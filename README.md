# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was mostly a learning experience on figuring out how to read javascript. I learned a lot about local vs global scopes while working on this, and a lot more on how things flow in JS. I also learned how to ask for help when I'm stuck, or else I won't be able to move forward and will remain stubborn. 

Alongside this, it's also good reference on how to connect a table to JS and plenty similar to that. 

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Usage

The main function of the page lies in the 'Add Employees' button. Once you press it, some pop-up prompts will show up, allowing the user to add 'employee' information.

Once the user stops putting in 'employee' information, a table will be made from the data provided.

With the data provided, a function also runs with their salaries, averaging it out for the user in the console.
